# Simulated-Annealing

This is the python2 version of the stochastic inversion algorithm Simulated Annealing shown in the dissertation with the link below

page 85-88. In the algorithm the general approach of Simulated Annealing is coupled with the ideas from Genetic Algorithm.

User needs to define number of generations (nog), number of models in each generation (nom), number of parameters for each model (nop), minimum and maximum values for each parameter (m_min & m_max), and temperature profile (T, control parameter).

There is a testing function (funcobj.py) in the code which can be used to understand the algorithm.
